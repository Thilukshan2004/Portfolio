    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        Hi, I'm Thilukshan, also known online as Dark Angel — a passionate and self-driven tech enthusiast from Sri Lanka. I'm currently a physical science student with a strong interest in cybersecurity, ethical hacking, and web development.
    </p>
    <p>
        I love experimenting with technology. I'm actively learning the fundamentals of networking and ethical hacking and plan to pursue certifications like CCNA to sharpen my skills further.
    </p>
    <p>
        I am also working to build a tech-focused blog where I write about cybersecurity, software tips, and tech hacks to help others stay informed and secure. Whether it's upgrading SSDs, customizing hardware, or creating secure digital environments, I’m always exploring new ways to learn and build.
    </p>
    <p>
        My long-term goal? To become a skilled cybersecurity expert  one day.
    </p>
